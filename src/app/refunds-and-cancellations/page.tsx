      <h1>Refunds &amp; Cancellations Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 07 December 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Refunds &amp; Cancellations Policy explains how refunds are handled
        for purchases made from Dressingschool’s digital products and services.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Nature of Our Products</h2>
      <p>
        Our primary offerings are digital in nature (for example: ebooks, guides,
        and other downloadable or in-app unlockable content). Once access is
        granted or a code is issued, the product is considered delivered.
      </p>

      <h2>2. General Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        As our products are digital and instantly accessible, we generally do not
        offer refunds after a successful purchase and delivery of the product or
        access code.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in genuine cases such as technical issues, duplicate payment, or
        failure to receive access after payment, we will review your request on a
        case-by-case basis.
      </p>

      <h2>3. When You May Be Eligible for a Refund</h2>
      <p>You may contact us to review a refund request if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You were charged but did not receive access to the product.</li>
        <li>You faced a technical error that prevented you from using the product.</li>
        <li>A duplicate transaction was made for the same product.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All such requests must be supported with proof of payment (transaction ID,
        date, and payment method).
      </p>

      <h2>4. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
      <p>We may not be able to process a refund in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change of mind after successful purchase.</li>
        <li>Access already used, downloaded, or shared.</li>
        <li>Incorrect purchase made by the user without contacting us first.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        Since our products are delivered digitally and usually unlocked immediately
        after payment, order cancellations are generally not possible once the
        payment is completed and access has been granted.
      </p>

      <h2>6. How to Request a Refund Review</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe you are eligible for a refund review, please contact us

      <h2>7. Processing Time</h2>
      <p>
        If a refund is approved, it will be processed to the original mode of
        payment within 7–14 working days, subject to your bank or payment
        provider’s timelines.
